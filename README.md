## 🔎 Key Tasks Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values in Age and Gender columns
* Standardized inconsistent categorical values (e.g., "M", "Male", "male")
* Corrected country name inconsistencies (e.g., "U.S.A", "USA")
* Removed duplicate records
* Converted date column to proper datetime format
